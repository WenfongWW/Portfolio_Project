# Shinobi Naruto Insignts 

## Overview
The Naruto Data Science Project leverages advanced data science techniques to analyze and visualize the rich lore of the Naruto anime series. This project encapsulates several aspects including web scraping for data acquisition, network analysis of character relationships, natural language processing for theme extraction, and machine learning for classifying ninja techniques.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into four main modules, each responsible for a different aspect of data analysis:

- **Web scraping**: 
  - **Description**: Scripts for scraping Naruto-related data from various fan websites.
  
- **Character Relationship**:
  - **Description**: Analysis tools to create and visualize a network graph of character interactions.
  
- **Jutsu classifier**:
  - **Description**: Machine learning models to classify ninja techniques (jutsus) based on their descriptions.
  
- **Sentiments Classifier**:
  - **Description**: Implements a zero-shot learning approach to identify predominant themes within the series' episodes.

## Technologies Used
This project utilizes the following technologies:
- **Python 3.8+**: Primary programming language
- **Libraries**: 
  - **Scrapy**: For web crawling
  - **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation
  - **NetworkX & PyViz**: For network analysis and visualization
