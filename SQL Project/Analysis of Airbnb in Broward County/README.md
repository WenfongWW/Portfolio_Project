# Airbnb Listings SQL Project - Broward County Analysis

## Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze data for Airbnb listings to derive actionable insights on revenue optimization and improving guest experiences, coupled with the discovery of market trends. The key tasks will include data cleaning: dropping irrelevant columns, and then handling missing values, along with duplicates. The analysis includes price trends, income estimation, neighborhood rankings by average price, review score, and occupancy rates. The host's performance and guest preferences are analyzed to identify key success drivers, such as the common amenities of highly rated properties. The results give data-driven recommendations for pricing strategies, property improvements, and targeted marketing that will contribute to making informed decisions.
