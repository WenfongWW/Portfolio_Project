
# Overview 

This repository contains code for a project on fake news detection using machine learning techniques. The project aims to build and evaluate models that can automatically classify news articles as real or fake based on their content. 

# Dataset 
The dataset used in this project consists of news articles collected from various sources. Each article is labeled as either real or fake. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. Here is the link:[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/algord/fake-news].

# Libraries and Tools Used 
- Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: for data visualization
- NumPy: for numerical computations
- Scikit-learn: for machine learning models and evaluation metrics
- Transformers library: for fine-tuning transformer-based models like BERT
- PyTorch: for deep learning model training
- WordCloud: for generating word clouds
- Graphviz: for visualizing decision trees
- Jupyter Notebook: for interactive development and analysis

# Models Explored
1. Random Forest Classifier
2. Logistic Regression
3. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sequence classification

# Steps
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing the dataset to gain insights and identify patterns.
3. Model Building: Training and evaluating different machine learning models.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
5. Conclusion: Summarizing the findings and discussing potential areas for improvement.
